## What is the McCumber Cube?

The McCumber Cube, also known as the Information Security Cube, was created by John McCumber in 1991. It is a three-dimensional model that shows all the key areas that we need to think about when protecting information. 

This security model has three dimensions: 

```markdown
1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems. 
2. The protection of information in each of its possible states. 
3. The security measures used to protect data. 
```

## First Dimension of cube (Foundational principles for protecting information)

**Confidentiality** - A set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. 

**Integrity** - Ensures system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. 

**Availability** - Allow authorized users to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. 

## Second Dimension of cube (Protection of information in each state)

**Processing** - Data that is being used to perform an operation (data in process). 

**Storage** - Data stored in memory or a permanent storage device such as hard drive or USB drive (data at rest). 

**Transmission** - Data travelling between information systems (data in transit).

## Third Dimension of cube (Security measures used to protect data)

**Awareness, training and education** - Ensure users understand security threats and how to protect information systems.

**Technology** - Hardware and software defenses like firewalls that detect and prevent attacks.

**Policy and procedure** - Administrative controls, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines, that guide information security efforts.

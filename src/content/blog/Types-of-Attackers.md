Cybersecurity threats come from many sources, and not all attackers are the same. From amateurs who rely on downloaded tools to highly trained groups backed by governments, understanding these categories helps us better protect our systems. In this post, we break down the main types of cyber attackers you may encounter.

### Amateurs (Script Kiddies)

The term “script kiddies” became popular in the 1990s. It refers to inexperienced or amateur hackers who rely on existing tools, scripts, or step-by-step guides they find online. They often do not fully understand how these tools work—they simply copy and execute.

Not all script kiddies are malicious; some are just curious. However, their lack of knowledge does not mean their attacks are harmless. Even simple tools can cause significant damage when used recklessly.

### Hackers (White, Gray, and Black Hat)

Hackers break into computer systems or networks, but not all of them share the same intentions. They are typically divided into three categories:

#### White Hat Hackers

- Ethical hackers
- Work with permission
- Identify vulnerabilities so organizations can fix weaknesses
- Their goal is to improve security

#### Gray Hat Hackers

- Not always malicious
- Explore vulnerabilities without explicit permission
- May report issues only when it suits their interests
- Could publish vulnerabilities online, exposing systems to attacks

#### Black Hat Hackers

- Malicious attackers
- Exploit vulnerabilities for illegal, personal, financial, or political gain
- Engage in activities like data theft, malware creation, or system sabotage

### Organized Hackers

These attackers include cyber-criminal organizations, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored groups. They tend to be highly skilled, well-coordinated, and often strongly funded.

#### Hacktivists

Hacktivists use hacking to promote political, social, or ideological messages. Their attacks aim to raise awareness or protest issues they feel strongly about.

#### State-Sponsored Attackers

State-sponsored attackers operate on behalf of governments. Their goals often include espionage, sabotage, or intelligence gathering. These groups are:

- Highly trained
- Well-funded
- Focused on achieving long-term national or political objectives

### Conclusion

Cyber attackers come in many forms—from curious beginners to sophisticated global operations. Understanding these categories helps us recognize threats and build better defenses. Whether it’s a script kiddie playing with downloaded tools or a state-sponsored group with targeted objectives, every attack can have serious consequences.

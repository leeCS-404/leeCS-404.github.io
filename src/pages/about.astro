    <p>
      Hi, I’m a computer science student passionate about building, learning, and sharing my journey.
      I started this blog to document the projects I work on, the concepts I explore, and the lessons
      I learn along the way. My motivation is simple: to grow as a developer while creating a space
      where others can follow my progress and maybe pick up something useful too.

    <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My interests span across programming, web development, and game design. I enjoy experimenting
      with modern frameworks like <strong>Astro</strong> for building fast, minimal websites, and
      I’ve also explored <strong>Unity</strong> for interactive projects. Alongside these, I’m
      continuously improving my skills in core computer science topics, algorithms, and software
      engineering practices.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming (Python, C++,C#)</li>
      <li>Web Development (Astro, React, html, CSS)</li>
      <li>Game Development (Unity)</li>
      <li>Exploring new tools and frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Right now, I’m focused on deepening my understanding of web technologies and building
      small projects that challenge me to apply what I learn. I’m also experimenting with
      combining design and development to create experiences that are both functional and
      enjoyable to use.
